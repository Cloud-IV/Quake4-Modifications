A repository containting the sources files for Quake 4 and branches dedicated to various modifications of Quake 4.

HOW TO INSTALL MODS
1. Download gamex86.dll from the branch that contains the mod you want. 

2. Navigate to your installation of Quake 4 and create a new folder with a name of your choice. For example, if you installed Quake 4 through Steam, you would navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4 and create a new folder in that directory with a name of your choice. This will be the folder for the mod you will install. 

3. Go into "q4base", copy "game000.pk4" (assuming you are using Windows), and paste it into the new folder you just made. 

4. Using an archive tool like winRAR, replace the "gamex86.dll" file in the copied "game000.pk4" with the "gamex86.dll" you downloaded from the repository. 

5. Download the "def" folder from the same branch and paste it into the folder you just created. 

NOTE: For exercise1's mod, you must also download the "weapons" folder located in the "sound" folder of the branch, create a new folder called "sound" in the mod folder that you created, and paste the "weapons" folder into that folder. 


BRANCHES

<<<<<<< HEAD
excercise1: Modification of the machine gun to do something crazy. When the machine gun is fired, San's voice plays instead of the normal fire effect, and when the player scopes in with the machine gun, the Metal Gear Solid alert sound is played. 
=======
excercise1: Modification of the machine gun to behave like a shotgun. Changes include 8 bullets fired per shot, large spread per shot (at least when not zoomed), clip size of 1 bullet to simulate a pump-action shotgun, massive reduction in viable range, and increased recoil animation time to give the impression of a larger oomph behind each shot. Unrelated sound changes include San's voice from Undertale playing each time the weapon is fired, and the Metal Gear Solid alert sound is played when the player scopes the machinegun.
